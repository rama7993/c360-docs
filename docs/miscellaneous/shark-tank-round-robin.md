# Shark Tank & Round Robin Management

The **C360 Partner Leads Management** module provides two flexible ways of distributing leads:

- **Shark Tank** ‚Üí Multiple users can claim leads, with admins reviewing claim requests.
- **Round Robin** ‚Üí Leads are distributed fairly among partners in rotation.

Both methods help ensure **efficient, transparent, and fair lead allocation**.
