title: Shark Tank & Round Robin Lead Distribution
---

The **C360 Partner Leads Management** module empowers you to distribute leads intelligently, ensuring **speed, fairness, and accountability**.  
You can choose between two flexible strategies:

- **Shark Tank** → Partners compete to claim available leads, with admins approving requests.
- **Round Robin** → Leads are assigned automatically and fairly in a rotation.

Both methods help you maximize efficiency while maintaining **full transparency in lead ownership**.

Both strategies offer smart automation controls:

Admins can configure these in:  
**System Configuration → Lead Assign**.
